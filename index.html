            <img src="../Images/RizalPark.jpg" alt="Rizal Monument (Manila)" 
                data-history="The Rizal Monument in Manila was built to honor Dr. José Rizal, the Philippines’ national hero who was executed by the Spanish colonial government on December 30, 1896. After the Philippines gained independence from Spain, plans were made to create a monument in the place where Rizal was executed, now known as Rizal Park (Luneta).<br><br>

                Construction of the monument began in 1907 and was completed in 1913.
                It was designed by Swiss sculptor Richard Kissling, whose design won an international competition.
                The monument features a bronze statue of Rizal standing over an obelisk, with his remains buried inside the base.<br><br>

                Since its unveiling, the Rizal Monument has become a powerful symbol of freedom, nationalism, and Filipino identity.<br>
                It is now one of the most important historical landmarks in the Philippines and a major site for national ceremonies and public remembrance.">

                 data-history="The Dapitan Shrine (Exile Home) is the place where Dr. José Rizal lived during his exile in Dapitan, Zamboanga del Norte from 1892 to 1896. Rizal was sent there by the Spanish authorities after he was accused of inspiring rebellion through his writings and reformist ideas.<br><br>

                While in Dapitan, Rizal lived a simple but productive life. He practiced medicine, treated patients for free, taught local children, improved the community by building a water system, and conducted scientific studies. He also met Josephine Bracken, who later became his partner. His home reflected his values of discipline, service, and love for learning. <br><br>

                Today, the Dapitan Shrine preserves replicas of Rizal’s houses, personal items, and works from his exile. It stands as a reminder of how Rizal continued to serve the Filipino people even while under punishment, making his exile one of the most meaningful periods of his life. <br>">

                Rizal spent his early life in this house, where he was influenced by his parents, especially his mother Teodora Alonso, who taught him how to read and love learning. The house witnessed his growth as a student, writer, and future reformist, shaping his values and character.<br><br>

                Today, the Rizal Ancestral House is preserved as a museum. It displays family belongings, furniture, and memorabilia that show Rizal’s family life and early influences, helping visitors understand the roots of the national hero.<br>">

                The monument shows Rizal as a thinker and writer, highlighting his role in promoting freedom, education, and equality through his works. It symbolizes the respect given to him not only in the Philippines but also abroad, where his ideas reached a wider audience.<br><br>

                 data-history="Noli Me Tángere was written by Dr. José Rizal in 1887 while he was in Europe, specifically in Berlin and later finalized in Ghent, Belgium.<br><br>

                Rizal wrote the novel as a way to expose the abuses and corruption of the Spanish colonial government and the friars in the Philippines. It was intended to awaken social awareness among Filipinos and inspire reform through education and peaceful means.<br><br>

                The novel was banned in the Philippines during the Spanish era but circulated secretly, eventually becoming a key work that fueled the Philippine reform movement and nationalist sentiment.<br>">

                Rizal wrote the novel during his time in Europe, reflecting his increasing frustration with the lack of reform in the Philippines under Spanish rule. Unlike Noli Me Tángere, which focused on social critique through personal stories, El Filibusterismo took a darker and more political tone, showing the consequences of oppression and corruption.<br><br>

                The novel was banned in the Philippines during the Spanish period but circulated secretly, inspiring Filipino reformists and revolutionaries by exposing systemic abuses and the urgent need for societal change.<br>">

                Mi Último Adiós became one of the most important literary works in Philippine history, symbolizing Rizal’s patriotism, courage, and ultimate sacrifice for the nation.<br>">

        <h3>Childhood in Calamba (1861-1870)</h3>
        <p>Jose Rizal was born on June 19, 1861, in the town of Calamba, Laguna. He belonged to a wealthy family; his father, Francisco Mercado, was an industrious farmer, and his mother, Teodora Alonso, was a highly educated woman. The family was affluent but faced constant discrimination from the Spanish friars.</p>
        <p>Rizal was a frail and sickly child, but his intellect was apparent early on. He learned the alphabet at age three. A defining moment in his childhood was the imprisonment of his mother on false charges, which opened his eyes to the injustice of the colonial justice system.</p>

        <h3>Education in Manila (Ateneo vs. UST)</h3>
        <p><strong>The Ateneo Years (1872-1877):</strong> Rizal studied at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila under the Jesuits. Unlike the other friars, the Jesuits encouraged independent thinking and science. Rizal thrived here, writing poetry, sculpting, and eventually graduating as class valedictorian with the highest honors (Sobresaliente).</p>
        <p><strong>The UST Struggles (1877-1882):</strong> He then enrolled at the University of Santo Tomas to study Philosophy and Letters, and later Medicine (Ophthalmology) to cure his mother's failing eyesight. However, his time at UST was unhappy. He felt the Dominican professors were hostile to Filipino students, and the method of instruction was obsolete and repressive. This disillusionment pushed him to leave for Spain.</p>

        <h3>The European Sojourn (1882-1887)</h3>
        <p>In May 1882, Rizal secretly departed for Spain without his parents' knowledge. In Madrid, he found an atmosphere of liberalism. He joined the <strong>Propaganda Movement</strong>, a group of Filipino expatriates calling for reforms. He completed his medical degree at the Universidad Central de Madrid and later traveled to Paris and Germany to specialize in eye surgery. It was in the solitude of European libraries that he began writing the novels that would change history.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="works-template" class="page-template">
        <h2>Literary Works & Impact</h2>
        <p>Rizal believed that a revolution must first start in the mind. If the people were uneducated and unaware of their rights, physical revolution would only lead to a new tyranny. His works were designed to expose the "social cancer" of the Philippines.</p>

            <div class="book-header">
                <span class="book-title">Noli Me Tángere</span>
                <span class="book-year">Published: 1887 (Berlin)</span>
            </div>
            <p><strong>English Title:</strong> "Touch Me Not" or "The Social Cancer"</p>
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The novel follows Juan Crisóstomo Ibarra, a young Filipino who returns from studying in Europe. Full of idealism, he plans to build a school for his town. However, he is thwarted at every turn by the corrupt Friar Dámaso, who had a personal vendetta against Ibarra's father. The novel exposes the abuses of the clergy, the superstition of the people, and the corruption of the government. It ends in tragedy, with Ibarra framed for a rebellion and forced to flee, while his love, Maria Clara, enters a nunnery.</p>
            <p><strong>Significance:</strong> This book awakened Filipino nationalism. It dared to depict the friars not as holy men, but as villains, which was considered blasphemy at the time.</p>

            </div>
            <p><strong>English Title:</strong> "The Reign of Greed"</p>
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The sequel takes a much darker turn. Ibarra returns in disguise as Simoun, a wealthy jeweler who corrupts the government from within to hasten its collapse. Unlike the idealistic Ibarra, Simoun believes only violent revolution can cleanse the country. He plots to blow up a wedding feast attended by the colonial elite using a lamp filled with explosives. The plot fails, and Simoun eventually commits suicide, taking his secrets to the grave.</p>
            <p><strong>Significance:</strong> While Noli demanded reforms, Fili discussed the inevitability of revolution. It was dedicated to the three martyred priests, Gomburza.</p>

        <h3>Other Major Writings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>La Indolencia de los Filipinos (The Indolence of the Filipinos):</strong> A brilliant sociological essay where Rizal argues that Filipinos are not inherently lazy. He proves that before the Spanish arrived, Filipinos were industrious traders. The apparent "laziness" was a result of the abusive galleon trade, forced labor, and lack of unity caused by colonial rule.</li>
            <li><strong>The Philippines a Century Hence:</strong> A political forecast where Rizal predicted that the Philippines would eventually declare independence from Spain and that the United States—a rising superpower—would likely become the next colonizer.</li>

        </div>

        <h3>Life in Dapitan (1892-1896)</h3>
        <p>Upon returning to the Philippines in 1892, Rizal founded *La Liga Filipina*, a peaceful civic organization. The Spanish authorities, fearing his influence, arrested him and exiled him to the remote town of Dapitan in Mindanao. </p>
        <p>Rizal did not waste his time in exile. He transformed the sleepy town by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Engineering:</strong> He built a waterworks system using bamboo and stones to provide clean water to the town.</li>
            <li><strong>Education:</strong> He opened a school for local boys, teaching them languages, math, and martial arts.</li>
            <li><strong>Science:</strong> He collected specimens of insects and animals, sending them to museums in Europe. Three species were named after him: a frog (Rhacophorus rizali), a beetle, and a flying lizard.</li>
            <li><strong>Romance:</strong> He met Josephine Bracken, an Irish woman who brought her blind father to Rizal for treatment. They fell in love and lived together as husband and wife, despite the priest refusing to marry them.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Trial and Death</h3>
        <p>In 1896, the Katipunan, a secret revolutionary society led by Andres Bonifacio, launched an armed uprising. Although Rizal had actually advised *against* the uprising (believing the people were unprepared and lacked weapons), the Spanish government used him as the scapegoat. He was arrested while on his way to Cuba and brought back to Manila.</p>
        <p>He was tried by a military court on charges of rebellion, sedition, and illegal association. The trial was a farce; no real evidence was presented, yet he was sentenced to death.</p>

        <h3>December 30, 1896</h3>
        <p>On the eve of his death, he wrote his final poem, Mi Último Adiós (My Last Farewell), hiding it inside a lamp. On the morning of December 30, he walked calmly to Bagumbayan Field. A Spanish doctor took his pulse and found it normal—he was not afraid to die.</p>
        <p>When the command "Fuego!" (Fire!) was given, the guns blazed. Rizal, standing with his back to the firing squad, used his last ounce of strength to twist his body around so that he would fall face up, looking at the sky. He died not as a traitor, but as a patriot.</p>
